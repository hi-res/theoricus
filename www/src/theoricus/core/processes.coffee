  Block the url state to be changed. Useful if there is a current {{#crossLink "Process"}}{{/crossLink}} being executed.

  ###*
  Responsible for handling the page/url change. It removes last Process, runs new Process dependencies, and then add the required Process. 

  __Execution order__

  1. `_on_router_change`

  2. `_filter_pending_processes`

  3. `_filter_dead_processes`

  4. `_destroy_dead_processes` - one by one, waiting or not for callback (timing can be sync/async)

  6. `_run_pending_process` - one by one, waiting or not for callback (timing can be sync/async)

  Executed when the route changes, it creates a {{#crossLink "Process"}}{{/crossLink}} to manipulate the route, removes the current process, and run the new process alongside its dependencies.
